## Makefile commands
All commands are not that complex. You should take a look at [Makefile](/Makefile) itself, but here's a quick overview:
- `make up` - starts all docker containers;
- `make down` - shuts down all docker containers;
- `make build` - builds all containers;
- `make restart` - restarts all containers;
- `make shell-php` - gets into php container and start bash command there from 1000 user;
- `make shell-redis` - gets into redis container.
